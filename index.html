    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Adventures in MOONMOON</strong>, an epic journey into the mysterious lunar core where survival, ingenuity, and chaos reign supreme. 
        Long ago, the goblin race was exiled from Faerûn by a united coalition of elves, dwarves, humans, and other beings, forced to flee to the moon aboard a massive 
        arc ship powered by Lunite crystals. This new home, affectionately called <em>Da Pit</em>, is a silo-like structure that extends deep into the lunar surface.
    </p>
    <p>
        Centuries have passed, and goblins have transformed the inhospitable moon into a thriving but precarious ecosystem. 
        Yet, cracks are forming in this carefully balanced society. The arc ship reactor is failing, threatening to destroy not only Da Pit but also the Earth itself. 
        Meanwhile, factions vie for control, secrets of Lunite power remain hidden, and whispers of returning to Faerûn stir debates among the goblins.
    </p>
    <p>
        Will you uncover the mysteries of Da Pit, unite its warring factions, and save your kind? Or will you exploit the chaos for your own ambitions? 
        The choice is yours in <strong>Adventures in MOONMOON</strong>.

    <h2>The Zones of Da Pit</h2>
    <p>
        Da Pit is a massive, silo-like structure that descends into the lunar core. Each level serves a specific purpose, 
        and the goblins who inhabit these zones reflect their environment.
    </p>
    <h3>Mines (Levels 133–144)</h3>
    <p>
        The lifeblood of Da Pit, the mines are where goblins extract Lunite crystals to power their society. 
        Dangerous and chaotic, the mines are home to hardy goblins who thrive in adversity.
    </p>

    <h3>The Grey Zones (Levels 90–132)</h3>
    <p>
        A melting pot of goblin cultures, the Grey Zones are a patchwork of different industries, from farming to manufacturing. 
        These levels are rife with political intrigue and cultural clashes.
    </p>

    <h3>The Mixing Zone (Levels 44–89)</h3>
    <p>
        A hub of trade and innovation, the Mixing Zone is where goblins from all walks of life converge. 
        This is the economic heart of Da Pit, but it’s also a hotbed of crime and espionage.
    </p>

    <h3>The Green Zone (Levels 2–43)</h3>
    <p>
        Reserved for governance and scientific advancement, the Green Zone is home to Da Pit’s elite goblins. 
        Its pristine halls are a stark contrast to the chaos of the lower levels.
    </p>
</section>
        <section id="factions" class="section-box">
    <h2>Factions</h2>
    <p>
        The goblins of Da Pit are divided among various factions, each vying for control or survival in their own way.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Lunite Families</strong>: Secretive elites who hoard Lunite knowledge and power.</li>
        <li><strong>Rustfire Rebels</strong>: Revolutionaries determined to overthrow the ruling class.</li>
        <li><strong>Skybound</strong>: Dreamers who seek to return to Faerûn, believing it to be their destiny.</li>
        <li><strong>The Unmoored</strong>: Anarchists who believe Da Pit should embrace chaos.</li>
    </ul>
</section>
        <section id="mechanics" class="section-box">
    <h2>Mechanics</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Lunite Effects:</strong> Exposure to raw Lunite crystals can grant temporary powers or cause mutations. Roll a d20:
        <ul>
            <li>1–5: Gain a glowing mark.</li>
            <li>6–15: Gain temporary magical abilities.</li>
            <li>16–20: Suffer a minor mutation.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Environmental Hazards:</strong> Each zone of Da Pit has unique challenges, from collapsing tunnels to radiation leaks.
